# MOVIE PROJECT
## Overview

This project is undertaken to help Microsoft determine how to make Box office hits as they intend on venturing into the movie making business.
I shall base the success of the movie on its average rating and the total gross revenue it generates.
## Data Source
The data used was sourced from the following sites:

[Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)

[IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)

[Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/)

[The MovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)

[The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/)

## Specifying the hypotheses
1.The  production budget of a movie is not related to the revenue earned from the movie.\n

2.The domestic gross revenue is inversely proportional to the worldwide gross revenue.\n

3.The length of the movie(runtime) is not related to the revenue earned from the movie.\n

4.The release month of a movie has no direct impact on the total gross revenue earned.

## Defining the Metric for Success
It will be deemed successful if the Null hypothesis fails to be rejected, i.e. if it is true.

## Experimental Design
1. Loading Datasets and Preparing the Data.

2. Data Cleaning to deal with Anomalies and Outliers.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis.

4. Hypothesis Testing to Implement the Solution.

5. Conclusions and Recommendation.

## Conclusions
1.The month of release of a movie is very critical to its success.
2.Production budget does not greatly influence the success of a movie. 
3.Domestic and worldwide gross revenue are directly related.
4.When producing a movie, the age restriction of the movie should be considered. This will then determine the runtime of the movie to be produced.
## Recommendations
The project was a success since all the hypotheses were tested conclusively.

To further improve the results of this project, other factors that might affect the success of a movie should be analyzed. 
These factors include:
1. The influence of directors, producers and actors over a movie's success.
2. Whether certain movie genres have higher chances of being hits
